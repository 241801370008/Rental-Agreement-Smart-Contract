# Rental-Agreement-Smart-Contract

# RentalAgreement - Decentralized Property Rental Management System

## Project Description

RentalAgreement is a blockchain-based smart contract system that revolutionizes property rental management by providing a transparent, secure, and automated platform for landlords and tenants. The system eliminates the need for traditional property management companies by automating rent collection, security deposit management, and dispute resolution through smart contract technology.

The platform enables landlords to create rental agreements, tenants to sign contracts and pay rent digitally, and provides an integrated dispute resolution mechanism. All transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust between parties while reducing administrative overhead and potential conflicts.

## Project Vision

- **Eliminates intermediaries** - Direct landlord-tenant relationships without property management companies taking large commissions
- **Ensures transparent transactions** - All payments, agreements, and actions recorded immutably on blockchain  
- **Automates rental processes** - Smart contracts handle rent collection, late fees, and deposit returns automatically
